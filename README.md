Smart Home Web Application with WebSocket Integration

This project is a web-based smart home control system that allows users to manage various devices such as LEDs and monitor sensor data (e.g., fire and gas sensors). It features real-time WebSocket communication to control devices and display sensor readings dynamically. Additionally, the system provides push notifications for important events like fire or gas leak detection.

Key features include:

WebSocket-based device control (LED1, LED2)
Real-time sensor data display (MQ2 sensor for gas detection)
Push notifications for fire and gas leak alerts
User authentication with a simple login system
Activity log for tracking user actions and sensor status
This project is designed to provide a simple yet efficient way to monitor and control smart home devices from a web interface.
